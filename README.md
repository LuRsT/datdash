This is a python dashboard framework inspired by
[Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/)/
[pyDashie](https://github.com/evolvedlight/pydashie) but without
the ruby and the ponies.

The aim of this project is to have the best aproximation possible to
[Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/) and possibly total compatibility.
